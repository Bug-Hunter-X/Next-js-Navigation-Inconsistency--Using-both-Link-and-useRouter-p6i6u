# Next.js Navigation Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications involving navigation inconsistencies when using both `next/link` and `useRouter` simultaneously.  The problem arises from potential conflicts in how these methods manage routing and state updates.

## Problem Description

The provided code uses `next/link` for navigating to the '/about' page and `useRouter` within the '/about' component for navigating back to the home page. This dual approach can lead to unpredictable behavior such as unexpected page transitions or even errors, especially in more complex applications with dynamic routes or client-side routing interactions.

## Solution

The solution provided eliminates this inconsistency by using a single, consistent navigation method throughout the application.  This approach simplifies navigation logic and ensures predictable, reliable routing behavior. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate between the home page and the about page. Note any unexpected behaviors with the original code.
5. Observe the improved, consistent behavior in the solution code.
